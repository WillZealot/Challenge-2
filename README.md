# William Tikhonenko's Portfolio
This is a portfolio for myself! Who am I? I am William!!!!
## Why was this made?
This was made just to showcase what I have learened so far in css as well as being a personal portfolio where i will be putting new projects.
Employers can look at this and decide if I am a great fit or not. 

## How was it made ?
This website was made using basic Html and a lot of CSS.
Getting the hang of flex and position and other elements was crazy.
